Random Language Generator
Generates words using user-selected letters and syllable patterns.
Python on Django


This is a pretty basic web app. It is just a generator, no user accounts or persistence of end user information.

I used Bootstrap 4 for the frontend.

To install:

1. create a virtual environment with virtualenv
2. Create and activate virtual environment
3. In the project directory random_language, run python manage.py runserver
4. You may have to python manage.py makemigrations and python manage.py migrate
5. Run python populate_words.py
6. Navigate to localhost:8000/randLang/show_letters
7. Website should come up.
